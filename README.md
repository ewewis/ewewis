# PORTFOLIO


## ABOUT ME:
My name is Ewelina. I completed my bachelor's degree in Administration at the Faculty of Law and Administration at UKSW. For nearly 10 years, I worked at the post office as an assistant, where I supported the work of postal workers, responded to complaints and ensured the quality of services provided. Continuous professional development is extremely important to me, which is why I completed a manual tester course with the intention of changing my career path. For over 2 years, I have been actively participating in various courses, workshops, webinars, and mentoring programs, as well as engaging in freelance projects. I have three dogs and a cat. I am interested in football and tennis. In my free time, I attend creative workshops such as pottery, macrame, making soaps and candles. I love flowers, forest. My connection with nature gives me peace, relaxation and a sense of being present in the moment.

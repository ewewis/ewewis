# Hello, my name is Ewelina
I am a software tester dedicated to delivering high-quality solutions. I am a hardworking, responsible person with a keen eye for detail. For over 2 years, I have actively participated in various courses, training sessions, webinars, and conferences, continuously improving my qualifications and skills. Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in creating test scenarios and test cases, defect reporting, exploratory testing, testing web and mobile applications, and API testing. I am proficient with tools such as Jira, Mantis, Figma, DevTools, Postman, and Cypress. I have a good understanding of HTML/CSS, basic knowledge of JavaScript, and experience with low-code/no-code tools like Bubble.io. Currently, I am enhancing my skills in automated testing using Cypress and deepening my knowledge of digital accessibility to help create more inclusive and functional solutions. My goal is to keep expanding my skill set and knowledge, with a focus on continuous personal and professional growth in various areas, not just software testing.
